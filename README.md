- Fork of [ChrisChrisLoLo/pusheenz40](https://github.com/ChrisChrisLoLo/pusheenz40). Also gathered info from [idawgz32](https://github.com/ChrisChrisLoLo/idawgz32) and [bunchiez40](https://github.com/ChrisChrisLoLo/bunchiez40).
- Layout is all-new, and design emphasizes ultra portable, small form factor while still having a fairly sane key map.

# Keyboard Design
As a parent, I often find myself "nap-trapped" but still needing to do computer work. After trying several Android touchscreen keyboards I have concluded that my fingers are not up for the task anymore. However, I still require a handheld form factor. More recently I spotted the uConsole from ClockworkPi and while it looks neat, I reason that if I have to wait many months to receive one, I might as well challenge myself to DIY. What could go wrong? 

The intent is to use these schematics (bunchiez40, pusheenz40, and idawgz32) as a launching-off point for an ambitious, DIY pocket keyboard, which will later evolve into a "deck" or "pocket" pc. Some requirements are currently listed in the [TODOs](TODO.md).

# Status
- prototype keyboard PCBs were ordered and will arrive Aug 23
- A rough-draft custom layout for the oddly shaped keyboard is done; Lots of fine-tuning to do.
- I've got my eyes set on a few display modules and I am interested in designing a CM4 carrier or picking another small SBC to dedicate to the project.
