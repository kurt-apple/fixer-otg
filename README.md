As a parent, I often find myself "nap-trapped" but still needing to do computer work. After trying several Android keyboards I have concluded that my fingers are not up for the task anymore. However, I still require a handheld form factor. More recently I spotted the uConsole from ClockworkPi and while it looks neat, I reason that if I have to wait many months to receive one, I might as well challenge myself to DIY. What could go wrong? The intent is to use these schematics as a launching-off point for an ambitious, DIY "deck" or "pocket" pc. Some requirements are currently listed in the [TODOs](TODO.md).

# Status
Design and scope is getting ironed out and I am learning a bunch of new tools/sortware as this is my first hardware project.
